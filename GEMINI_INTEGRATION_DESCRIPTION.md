## VeriWeave: Multimodal Forensic Analysis with Gemini 3


### Draft Description (Optimized for Impact):

VeriWeave showcases Gemini 3 Pro Preview’s breakthrough multimodal reasoning through **batch cross-file analysis** - a capability that sets it apart from traditional single-file verification tools. We send multiple documents (images, videos, PDFs) to Gemini 3 in a single API call, enabling the model to perform unified forensic reasoning across the entire document set.

**Key Gemini 3 Features:**

1. **Batch Multimodal Reasoning** (Core Innovation): Multiple files analyzed together in one request, allowing Gemini 3 to detect cross-file inconsistencies, correlate information, and provide unified authenticity conclusions. This demonstrates Gemini 3's advanced reasoning across multiple documents simultaneously.

2. **Multimodal Processing**: Gemini 3 processes images, videos, and PDFs together, extracting visual, textual, and structural information in parallel.

3. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Detailed forensic prompts guide Gemini 3 through six analysis dimensions: multimodal matching, document forensics, visual artifacts, logical consistency, synthetic signs, and shadow/perspective analysis.

4. **Structured JSON Output**: Gemini 3 returns comprehensive analysis including authenticity scores (0-100), risk levels, category-specific confidence scores, technical forensic signals, and detailed reasoning - all in structured JSON format.

**Why This Matters**: Traditional tools analyze files in isolation. VeriWeave's batch analysis enables Gemini 3 to detect fraud patterns across document chains (e.g., invoice + receipt + bank statement), making it powerful for real-world fraud detection where inconsistencies only appear when documents are analyzed together.

This application demonstrates Gemini 3's superior reasoning in a critical real-world context: preventing billions in document fraud through advanced multimodal AI.
